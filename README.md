I currently work as a DevOps Engineer for [Mama Money](https://mamamoney.co.za) and super passionate about making businesses succeed by building reliable, stable and scalable systems, and enabling development teams to move faster. 

I specialize in AWS, Containers and Observability and very curious by heart. I have a strong passion for knowledge sharing and you will find me producing content on my blogs.

### Some Fun Facts about me:

:zap: I wanted to be a professional cricket player when I grew up, I still think about it every now and then, but I am so blessed for where I am today, and super passionate about what I do. I love tinkering with raspberry pi's, self-hosted setups, etc. I am also big into Call fo Duty Gaming.
